# Laser Security Alarm System with Counter

## Project Title

**Laser Security Alarm System with Counter**: A reliable security system utilizing laser technology and a counter for intrusion detection and monitoring.

## Project Description

The **Laser Security Alarm System with Counter** is designed to provide enhanced security by creating an invisible perimeter using a laser beam. When an object or person interrupts the beam, an alarm is triggered, and the event is logged by incrementing a counter displayed on an LCD. This project uses an Arduino microcontroller, IR sensors, LDR, and various other components to form a customizable and scalable security solution.

### Key Features:
- **Intrusion Detection**: Detects any interruptions in the laser beam and triggers an alarm via a buzzer.
- **Visitor Counter**: Tracks the number of intruders or people entering the secured area using IR sensors and displays the count on an LCD.
- **Customizable**: The system can be adjusted for different security zones by varying the number of lasers and sensors.
- **Applications**: Suitable for homes, offices, warehouses, museums, and sensitive data centers.
